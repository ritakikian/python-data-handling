This repository contains Python scripts for handling various data related operations using dictionaries.

1. merge-dictionaries.py: contains a function that merges 2 dictionaries. if there are any duplicate keys, values from the second dictionary override those values from the first one.

2. word-count.py: takes a sentence and counts the occurrences of each word, and utputs a dictionary where keys are words and values are their frequencies.

3. employee-management.py:manages employee records using a dictionary structure, and allows adding new employees and counting total employees in the company.

4. invert-dictionaries.py: takes a dictionary where values are unique and inverts it. It also outputs a new dictionary where keys are the original values and values are lists of keys that had that value.
